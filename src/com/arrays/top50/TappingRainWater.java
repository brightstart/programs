Given an array of N non-negative integers arr[] representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = {2, 0, 2}
Output: 2
Explanation: The structure is like below.
We can trap 2 units of water in the middle gap.

Follow the steps mentioned below to implement the approach:

Create two arrays left[] and right[] of size N. Create a variable (say max) to store the maximum found till a certain index during traversal.
Run one loop from start to end:
In each iteration update max and also assign left[i] = max.
Run another loop from end to start:
In each iteration update max found till now and also assign right[i] = max.
Traverse the array from start to end.
The amount of water that will be stored in this column is min(left[i], right[i]) â€“ array[i]
Add this value to the total amount of water stored
Print the total amount of water stored.
Below is the implementation of the above approach.
Time Complexity: O(N)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
